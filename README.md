## Cleaning
- Does basic encoding of variables to numeric variables for the PRIDIT analysis.
- Coding of variables depends on risk profiles of the categories i.e 1 = high risk
                                                                     5 = low risk
## PRIDIT
- Transforms and standardizes the dataset for the PCA analysis.
- Runs the PCA model to identify the top 10% risky claims.
- Conducts 2 sided t-test to compare sub-groups such as Muslim vs non-Muslim, developed countries vs non developed countries etc.
- Visualizes the PCA scores using histograms and KDE plots.

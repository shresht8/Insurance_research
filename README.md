This research involves 2 parts to it:

## Part 1

### PRIDIT Analysis and Drug switching Analysis

PRDIT analysis involves creating a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to insurance claims data to identify high risk claims. Features included financial status, country of policy holder, claimed_amount etc. This model helped me identify the top 10% most risky claims.

Drug Switching Analysis involved the analysis of the copay/coinsurance/Out of pocket amount for the top 20 most prescribed drugs


## Part 2

### Plan Switching Analysis

Analysed the impact of plan switching on insurance costs. Conducted various tests to come to the conclusion that plan switching doesn't have a significant impact on insurance costs.
